    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy.
    // They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way

    /*const team2 = players.slice(); 
    // team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team2);*/

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    /*const team3 = [].concat(players);
    //team3[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team3);*/

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    /*const team4 = [...players];
    //team4[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team4);*/

    // or use Array.from
     
    /*const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team5);*/

    //Numerous ways to update it, and the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap = {...person};
    console.clear();

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // Object.assign only clones the first level of object
    //Way to clone full object would be:

     const wes = {
       name:'Wes',
       age:'100',
       social: {
         twitter: '@wesbos',
         facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
       }
     };
     
     const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
     console.log(dev);
     //This turns wes object into a string, then parses it
     //into a JSON object, with full depth of object props
     //Might be heavy on performance
